**When**: May 2017

**Workflow**: Create GitHub issues, refactor and merge Pull Requests
* Maintainers create GitHub issues with the "SpringCleaning" label in the Parent.
* Contributors fork and refactor [SpringCleaning labeled issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning) and create a Pull request from Head (Fork) to Base (Parent).

**Creating GitHub issues**
* Maintainers select refactor candidates based on: [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) analysis. Better Code Hub is a [GitHub Integration](https://github.com/integrations/better-code-hub)

**Merging Pull Requests**
* Contributors refactor and create a Pull request from the Head of their Fork to the base of the Parent repo.
* Maintainers can use Better Code Hub Pull request integration to validate the quality and accept the merge.

# Why this Open Source Spring Cleaning initiative?

Starting out contributing to open source projects can be daunting. Some say that open source can be intimidating. Opening up the issues belonging to popular open source projects typically means unfolding a set of very technical tasks for which deep codebase knowledge is crucial. Here's [one](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues) example. Where would you start...? 

We (the [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) team at [SIG](https://www.sig.eu)) see untapped potential here. There's latent developer talent that can be leveraged to bring open source projects forward, if a more "gentle" starting point would exist. We hold the belief that code quality improvements would fit the bill nicely. Maintainers can create bite sized refactoring candidates and make them available for the community. The community can pick these up and do them, sparking a positive and welcoming exchange between the maintainers and new contributors. Now, "the ice is broken" and new faces get the hang of it, and become motivated to provide more and increasingly difficult but rewarding contributions. 

# What's in it for you? 

If you participate in this effort we will reward you: 

* If you're a contributor, we will send you a hard copy of [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) if you are one of the first 100 contributors that get a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted.

* If you're a maintainer, you get a cleaner code base and new contributors to extend your repository. üòä¬†

# How does it work?

* Maintainers use [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) to receive a set of proposed prioritized refactoring candidates. They then create from them GitHub issues labelled 'SpringCleaning'. [GitHub help on creating and editing labels is here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-editing-labels-for-issues-and-pull-requests/)

* Contributors search [these issues](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning), pick them up and follow the normal [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) that they are used to. Creating a Pull Request against the master of original source when they are ready. 

* Maintainers can integrate the Better Code Hub Pull request analysis in their continuous integration and merge the refactoring if they're happy with it. 

# Getting started 

**As a maintainer**

Send us a Pull request with your Better Code Hub Badge code [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceSpringCleaning/OpenSourceSpringCleaning.github.io/blob/master/SpringCleaningScoreBoard.md). (our Open Source Spring Cleaning Score Board) You can also send us an e-mail if you prefer and we'll put it up there. 

Then create 'SpringCleaning' issues using [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). 

**As a contributor**

Search for repos which have [issues with the "SpringCleaning" label, on Github](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning). 

**How do I know my contribution is ready to be accepted?**

You can't know for sure of course, it's up to the maintainer. But you can use Better Code Hub on your proposed contribution and check the guidelines before contacting the maintainer. 

**Using [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com)**

... is easy. Head over to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and login with your GitHub account. You'll then see your repos, and you can start an analysis clicking the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button. It will analyze the default branch. 

To enable Better Code Hub to run on your own fork for every Push and Pull Request on your repo, click the ‚öô icon and toggle the "Push & Pull request analysis" switch.
