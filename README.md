**When**: May 2017

**Where**: [Issues Labeled SpringCleaning on Github](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning)

**Whois**: [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) - a [GitHub Integration](https://github.com/integrations/better-code-hub) provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu).


# What is the BIG idea here?

* With Open Source Spring Cleaning we at Better Code Hub want to help the open source community to finally fix those pesky refactorings that we all know but never make the time to fix. Get rid of those refactoring that slow you down creating great new features.

* At the same time we would like to activate (new) contributors globally by handing them clear things to refactor that really matter.

# What is the reward?

* We will send free hard copy of our book [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) to the first 100 Contributors that have a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted.

* A cleaner code base for the Maintainer.

# How does it work ?

* By labeling issues with 'SpringCleaning' Maintainers create small tasks for Contributors that contain prioritized refactorings. 

* The Contributors follow the normal GitHub flow and create a Pull Request when they are ready.

* The Maintainers can review these Pull Requests and merge the improvement.

* We will host a scoreboard with badges for the repos that particpate. 

# For a Maintainer

# 1. How do i get those spring cleaning issues

* We do not want to interfere with your backlog. You can run Better Code Hub and based on it's analysis make new issues labeled 'SpringCleaning' or add the label to existing issues that are accessible for contributors.

# 2. Why should i accept these Pull Requests from people unknown to me?

* Every Pull Request is analyzed for improvements in code quality by Better Code Hub. These results are in the Pull Request conversation. Maintainers will only accept improvements to the code.

* You help growing the Open Source Community by accepting Pull Requests that are of high quality. Contributors will do their first contribution to a real project. 

# 3. How to enable Better Code Hub to validate each Pull Request?

* To enable Better Code Hub to run for every Push and Pull Request on your repo, click the ‚öô icon and toggle the switch:

# For a Contributor

# 1. Fork a repo that has issues labeled SpringCleaining'

* then follow the normal GithubFlow: Fork, Clone, Push, Create a Pull Request to master of the original repo. 

* the Maintainer will review, and hopefully merge :-)

# 2. How do i know my contribution is ready to be accepted? 

* Better Code Hub will help you: your commits will be evaluated for compliance with these 10 guidelines for building maintainable software
