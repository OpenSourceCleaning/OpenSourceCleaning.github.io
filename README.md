# What is the idea here, what is the reward?

* With Open Source Spring Cleaning we at Software Improvement Group want to help te open source community to finally fix those refactorings that slow you down. And on the same time we would like to activate contributors globally by handing them clear things to refactor that really matter.

* We will send free book to the first 100 Contributors that have a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted

* A cleaner code base for the Maintainer

# How does it work in general?

* By labeling issues with 'SpringCleaning' Maintainers create small tasks for Contributors that contain prioritized refactorings using 

* The Contributors follow the normal GitHub flow and create a Pull Request when they are ready.

* The Maintainers can review these Pull Requests and merge the improvement.
