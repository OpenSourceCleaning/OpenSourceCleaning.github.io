**What**: Open Source Spring Cleaning.

**When**: May 2017

**Where**: [Issues Labeled SpringCleaning on Github](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning)

**Who** is behind this intiative [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) - a [GitHub Integration](https://github.com/integrations/better-code-hub) provided by [Software Improvement Group SIG](https://www.sig.eu).



# What is the idea here?

* With Open Source Spring Cleaning we at Software Improvement Group want to help the open source community to finally fix those pesky refactorings that slow you down. And at the same time we would like to activate (new) contributors globally by handing them clear things to refactor that really matter.

# what is the reward?

* We will send free hard copy of our book [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) to the first 100 Contributors that have a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted.

* A cleaner code base for the Maintainer

# How does it work in general?

* By labeling issues with 'SpringCleaning' Maintainers create small tasks for Contributors that contain prioritized refactorings. 

* The Contributors follow the normal GitHub flow and create a Pull Request when they are ready.

* The Maintainers can review these Pull Requests and merge the improvement.

## How do i get those spring cleaing issues

* We do not want to interfere with your backlog. You can run Better Code Hub and based on it's analysis make new issues labeled 'SpringCleaning' or add the label to existing issues that are accessible for contributors 

## Why should i accept these foreign Pull Requests?

* Every Pull Request is analyzed for improvements in code quality by Better Code Hub. These results are in the Pull Request conversation. Maintainers will only accept improvements to the code

## How to enable Better Code Hub to run on Pull Request?

* To enable Better Code Hub to run for every Push and Pull Request on your repo, click the ‚öô icon and toggle the switch:
