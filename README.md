# What is Open Source Spring Cleaning?

Starting out contributing to open source projects can be daunting. Opening up the issues pertaining to popular open source projects typically means unfolding a set of very technical tasks for which without deep codebase knowledge are pretty much untouchable. Here's [one](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues) example. Where would you start...? 

We (the [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) team at [SIG](https://www.sig.eu)) think there's untapped potential here. There's latent talent that can be leveraged to bring open source projects forward, if a more "gentle" starting point would exist. We hold the belief that code quality improvements would fit the bill nicely. Maintainers can create bite sized refactoring candidates and make them available for the community. The community can pick these up and do them, sparking a positive and welcoming exchange between the maintainers and new contributors. Now, "the ice is broken" and new faces get the hang of it, and became motivated to provide more and increasingly difficult but rewarding contributions. 

# What's in it for you? 

If you participate in our effort you get rewarded with the following: 

* If you're a contributor, we will send you a hard copy of [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) if you are one of the first 100 contributors that get a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted by the repository maintainer.

* If you're a maintainer, you get a cleaner code base and new contributors to extend your repository. üòä¬†

# How does it work?

* maintainers use [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) to receive a set of prioritized refactoring candidates. They then make   issues labelled 'SpringCleaning' with them for contributors. 

* contributors pick them up and follow the normal [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) and create a Pull Request when they are ready.

* maintainers can review these Pull Requests and merge the improvement.

* we will host a scoreboard with badges for the repos that participate. 

# Getting started as a maintainer

Send us a Pull request with your Better Code Hub Badge code [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceSpringCleaning/OpenSourceSpringCleaning.github.io/blob/master/SpringCleaningScoreBoard.md).

# Getting started as a contributor

* Fork a repo that has issues labeled 'SpringCleaning'

* then follow the normal GithubFlow and work on it: Fork, Clone, Push, Create a Pull Request to master of the original repo. 

* the Maintainer will review, and hopefully merge :-)

# 2. How do i know my contribution is ready to be accepted? 

* Better Code Hub will help you: your commits will be evaluated for compliance with these 10 guidelines for building maintainable software
