# What is Open Source Spring Cleaning?

Starting out contributing to open source projects can be daunting. Opening up the issues pertaining to popular open source projects typically means unfolding a set of very technical tasks for which without deep codebase knowledge are pretty much untouchable. Here's [one](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues) example. Where would you start...? 

We (the [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) team at [SIG](https://www.sig.eu)) think there's untapped potential here. There's latent talent that can be leveraged to bring open source projects forward, if a more "gentle" starting point would exist. We hold the belief that code quality improvements would fit the bill nicely. Maintainers can create bite sized refactoring candidates and make them available for the community. The community can pick these up and do them, sparking a positive and welcoming exchange between the maintainers and new contributors. Now, "the ice is broken" and new faces get the hang of it, and became motivated to provide more and increasingly difficult but rewarding contributions. 

# What's in it for you? 

If you participate in this effort we'll reward you: 

* If you're a contributor, we will send you a hard copy of [‚ÄúBuilding Maintainable Software‚Äù](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920049159.do) if you are one of the first 100 contributors that get a Spring Cleaning Pull Request accepted.

* If you're a maintainer, you get a cleaner code base and new contributors to extend your repository. üòä¬†

# How does it work?

* maintainers use [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com) to receive a set of proposed prioritized refactoring candidates. They then create from them GitHub issues labelled 'SpringCleaning'.

* contributors search them, pick them up and follow the normal [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) they're used to - creating a Pull Request when they are ready.

* maintainers can review these Pull Requests and merge the improvement if they're happy with it. 

# Getting started 

**As a maintainer**

Send us a Pull request with your Better Code Hub Badge code [here](https://github.com/OpenSourceSpringCleaning/OpenSourceSpringCleaning.github.io/blob/master/SpringCleaningScoreBoard.md). (our Open Source Spring cleaning scoreboard)

You can also send us an e-mail if you prefer and we'll put it up there. 

Then create 'SpringCleaning' issues using [Better Code Hub](https://bettercodehub.com). 

**As a contributor**

Search for repos which have [issues with the "SpringCleaning" label, on Github](https://github.com/issues?utf8=‚úì&q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aspringcleaning). 

**How do I know my contribution is ready to be accepted?**

You can't know for sure of course, it's up to the maintainer. But you can use Better Code Hub on your proposed contribution and check the guidelines for confirmation of your proposal. 

Using Better Code Hub is easy. Head over to [bettercodehub.com](https://bettercodehub.com) and login with your GitHub account. You'll then see your repos, and you can start an analysis clicking the ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button. It will analyze the default branch. 

To enable Better Code Hub to run on your fork for every Push and Pull Request on your repo, click the ‚öô icon and toggle the "Push & Pull request analysis" switch.

## Feedback 

Don't hesitate to send us feedback about our platform at bettercodehub@sig.eu. We're always happy to hear improvement suggestions from you.  

*Let's do some thorough cleaning here, one Pull Request at a time!*
